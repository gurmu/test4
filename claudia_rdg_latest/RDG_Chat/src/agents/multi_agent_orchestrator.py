"""
Semantic Kernel multi-agent orchestration (GCC).

HYBRID APPROACH — "LLM decides, code enforces invariants":

1. KB-FIRST always: run ITSM search before any reasoning.
2. Python code enforces 3 NON-NEGOTIABLE invariants:
   - Invariant #1: kb_hits_count == 0 → KB_MISS is fact (LLM cannot claim KB_HIT)
   - Invariant #2: If LLM says urgency=="ambiguous" or proposed_action=="ask_user"
                    → block all tool calls, force the "Reply with 1 or 2" prompt
   - Invariant #3: Follow-up "1"/"2" only when conversation state is WAITING_FOR_CHOICE
3. LLM does all interpretation + routing (KB sufficiency, urgency, next action).
4. No KB_SCORE_THRESHOLD or top_score gating.  Scores logged but never routed on.
5. Tool call failures are captured, never crash the orchestration.
6. Persistent conversation state in Cosmos DB (survives across Teams activities).
